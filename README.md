# Overview

We were hired by a company that is looking to expand into the aircraft industry, with an interest in private and commercial enterprises. 


# Key Business Problem and Question

The end goal of our data analysis, is to answer the question of which aircraft is going to be the lowest risk for the company's endeavour's, as well as provide three concrete business recommendations explaining which aircraft the company should invest in.


# Data Analysis And Understanding


### Source of Original Data

The source of the data is Kaggle's Aviation Accident Database & Synopses dataset.
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses


### Description of Our Data

This data contains plane crash information from as early as 1948 to 2021 consisting our various components explaining each crash like the make and model of the plane that crashed and the damage done to the plane from the accident, etc.


### Three Visualizations

- Visualization one is a comparison of the crashes of each make with a different amount of engines. The color of each make's bar represents how many were Injured in the total number of crashes, while the text represens how many were uninjured for the total amount of crahses.

# Conclusion

After analysing the data and forming our visualizations we are able to come to the conclusion of recommending the following for passenger and cargo transportation via plane, and the (testing) helicopter;

- The Boeing 747 becuase the Boeing 747 has a balance of both safety and space, a nose that opens, and also has the ability to carry passengers. 

- Makes three to four engines depending on commercial or cargo, because when comparing all the makes that crashed with 2 engines we can see there is a significantly larger amount of crashes with 2 engines than there are with 3 or 4 engines. 3 Engines for commercial is recommended because our data analysis shows less crashes with injuries while 4 engines will most likely be recommended for cargo because of it higher power but slightly higher injury rate.

- And the Sikorsky S76 helicopter.
