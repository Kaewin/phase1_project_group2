### Description of Our Data

This data contains plane crash information from as early as 1948 to 2021 consisting our various components explaining each crash like the make and model of the plane that crashed and the damage done to the plane from the accident, etc.


### Three Visualizations

- Visualization one is a comparison of the crashes of each make with a different amount of engines. The color of each make's bar represents how many were Injured in the total number of crashes, while the text represens how many were uninjured for the total amount of crahses.



# Conclusion

After analysing the data and forming our visualizations we are able to come to the conclusion of recommending the follwoing for passenger and cargo transportaion via plane, and the (testing) helicopter;

- The Boeing 747 model and make becuase (...) the Boeing 747 has a balance of both safety and space, and also has the ability to carry passengers. 

- With four engines (...)
